chess application ideas for my website: https://jonze.uk/chess <br />
right now it's just a javascript json parser, but I plan to incorporate
a hosted rest API via AWS (such as API Gateway with Lambda or an EC2 instance) to reduce redundant data as well as to decouple the speed
of the chess.com API from my website loading.
